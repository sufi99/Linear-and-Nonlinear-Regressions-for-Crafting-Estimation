Crafting Time Estimation

We will be using regressions, of both the linear and non-linear persuasions. We will be using these to create estimates in the amount of time required to get from a given crafting state to another crafting state, i.e. to produce a heuristic cost for the planning done in homework 2.

We will be constructing the following models:

A linear regression solved via raw matrix operations, as discussed in class
A linear regression solved via numpy's library
A linear regression solved via Stochastic Gradient Descent with an artificial neural network
A linear regression using a deep artificial neural network
A non-linear regression using a deep artificial neural network
Finally, the non-linear regression will be used as the heuristic in an A* search of the planning space
